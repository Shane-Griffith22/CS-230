Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a client that would like to upload their new game "Win, Lose, or Draw" onto a web based platform for all devices to use to maximize the "reach" of their game. Only one unique instance of a game with all unique usernames should exist at any given time. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

Researching relavent technologies for what "The Gaming Room" was looking for and offering recommendations as to how the company should proceed as someone who is just starting out with a game with this type of reach is where I feel that I have done particularly well in this project. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Having the design documentation beside me when developing the code for the project was very helpful. There was no guess work from my point of view. I knew exactly what the layout of the project was supposed to be all I had to do was ensure that the program met all of the requirements required by the customer. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I highly recommended AWS throughout this project. In theory this would make a lot of sense in my eyes for "The Gaming Room" to utilize. However, I'm wondering how much sense AWS would make to use in the real world due to costs and other factors. If I could, I would go back and do more research on this topic to verify it would make sense financially to do. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I thought that the user's needs were pretty straight forward for this project. I was able to read through the given prompt and understand what the requirements were right away. This gave me a good head start without having to many unanswered questions. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

When deveoping this program, I started with the functions. Starting there and going into main and testing each one individually gives me a good foundation and understanding on how each part of the project works. This also lets me verify that each function works on its own, so as I move through the program I can use the fact that I know each function works as it should for troubleshooting anything that might not be working properly.
